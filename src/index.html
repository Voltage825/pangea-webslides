                Typically used when importing/exporting goods (regardless of location, be it domestic or

                A Letter of Credit (LC) is a written undertaking given by a bank on behalf of the buyer to pay the
                seller an amount of money within a specified time, provided the seller presents documents which
                comply with the terms laid down in the Letter of Credit.
                A letter of credit is issued by the buyer’s bank typically via another bank, called the Advising
                Bank. The Advising Bank will be asked to either advise the LC:
                &nbsp;(a) Unconfirmed: Advising Bank merely informs the seller of the terms and conditions of the
                LC
                &nbsp;(b) Confirmed: Advising Bank adds its own commitment that payment will be made if the terms

              </li>
              <li>
                Our importing customer can specify when and under what conditions payment will be made, therefore
                giving them some ability to dictate to their seller what shipping documents they need to produce
                together with shipment date and the method of transportation.
              </li>
              <li>
                By providing the seller with some certainty of payment our importing customer may have been able to
                negotiate longer credit terms or an improved price for the goods.
              </li>
              <li>
